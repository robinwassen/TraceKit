TraceKit - Cross browser stack traces.
=====================================

**NOTE: This is a WIP fork, don't use it.**

### Supports all major browsers, from IE6 to Opera, the Andriod webview and everywhere in between.

Not all browsers support stack traces on error objects, but TraceKit squeezes out as much useful information as possible and normalizes it. 3kB minified + gzipped
